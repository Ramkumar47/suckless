# tmux configuration
This folder contains tmux configuration files with catppuccin customization

Place the contents of this folder in ~/.config/tmux/ folder

This configuration has a customized status bar that requires nerd fonts for
proper work. These nerd patched fonts can be installed from ../fonts/ directory
in the OpenSUSE repository.

Similarly, if the old configuration for tmux is needed means, it can be
taken from the OpenSUSE repository. Any further changes to tmux will be
updated to this repo only as of Sat Mar 29 03:02:33 PM IST 2025.
