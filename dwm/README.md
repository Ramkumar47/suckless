# dwm source #
This is the customized *dynamic window manager (dwm)* source code.

The color addition was made through a patch *patches/dwm_color_status.diff*
and following the instructions on https://dwm.suckless.org/patches/statuscolors/

Note the way of using vim to include color tags.

Some custom keybindings were also included.

Further, the colorscheme related to Catppuccin was also induced and the default
wide background coloring of the bar when opening an application was removed
by modifying the line 770 in dwm.c file
