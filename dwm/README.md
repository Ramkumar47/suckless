# dwm source #
This is the customized *dynamic window manager (dwm)* source code.

The color addition was made through a patch *patches/dwm_color_status.diff*
and following the instructions on https://dwm.suckless.org/patches/statuscolors/

Note the way of using vim to include color tags.

Some custom keybindings were also included.
